Quick 10-step roadmap (tiny, 2-week friendly)
Blink LED (digital OUT) — done now.
Button input + INPUT_PULLUP.
PWM (analogWrite) — LED dimming, motor speed.
analogRead — potentiometer / LDR.
Non-blocking timing (millis) + state machine.
Serial debug (Serial.print) + parsing.
Servo control (Servo library).
I²C sensor / OLED display (Wire, display lib).
Interrupts & pulseIn (buttons, IR).
Mini project: two-way traffic light + pedestrian button (combine 2,5,8).
